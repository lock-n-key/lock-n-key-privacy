				upload and manage photos and videos, organize them into albums, and
				retrieve or download them at any time. For privacy purposes, users may
				customize the app's name and icon (e.g., to resemble a calculator or
				calendar).

					crash logs used to improve app stability and performance.

				techniques. We implement safeguards to protect against unauthorized
				access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
			<p>
				We may use third-party providers (such as cloud storage, analytics
				tools, or payment processors) that adhere to standard data protection
				policies. These services are used only as necessary and in compliance
				with applicable privacy laws.
			</p>

			<h2>5. User Controls</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Users can delete uploaded content directly from the app.</li>
				<li>
					Subscriptions can be managed or canceled via the app store platform
					used for purchase.

					additional privacy.

			</ul>

			<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>

				We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
				reflected on this page, and significant changes will be communicated
				through the app if necessary.
